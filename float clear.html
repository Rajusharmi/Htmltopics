            Environment means anything that surrounds us. It can be living (biotic) or non-living (abiotic) things. 
            It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces. Living things live in their environment. 
            They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment.
             In the environment there are different interactions between animals, plants, soil, water, and other living and non-living things
